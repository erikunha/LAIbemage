## CI/CD Secret Injection

Secrets in CI/CD pipelines require careful handling to avoid exposure in logs, artifacts, or pull request contexts.

### GitHub Actions

- Use **repository secrets** or **environment secrets** via `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.
- Prefer **OIDC federation** (`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` with `role-to-assume`) over long-lived access keys.
- Environment secrets with required reviewers add approval gates for production deployments.
- GitHub automatically masks secrets in logs, but avoid `echo` or `toJSON()` on secret values.

### GitLab CI

- Store secrets as **CI/CD variables** with the `masked` and `protected` flags enabled.
- Use **HashiCorp Vault integration** (`secrets:vault`) for dynamic secret injection without storing values in GitLab.
- Scope variables to specific environments (`production`, `staging`) to enforce least privilege.

### Universal Patterns

- **Never echo or print** secret values in pipeline output, even for debugging.
- **Use short-lived tokens** (OIDC, STS AssumeRole) instead of static credentials wherever possible.
- **Restrict PR access**: do not expose secrets to pipelines triggered by forks or untrusted branches.
- **Rotate CI secrets** on the same schedule as application secrets; pipeline credentials are attack vectors too.
- **Audit pipeline logs** periodically for accidental secret exposure that masking may have missed.


## Pre-Commit Secret Detection

Catching secrets before they reach version control is the most cost-effective defense. Two leading tools cover this space.

### gitleaks

```toml
# .gitleaks.toml: minimal configuration
[extend]
useDefault = true

[[rules]]
id = "custom-internal-token"
description = "Internal service token pattern"
regex = '''INTERNAL_TOKEN_[A-Za-z0-9]{32}'''
secretGroup = 0
```

- Install: `brew install gitleaks` or download from GitHub releases.
- Pre-commit hook: `gitleaks git --pre-commit --staged`
- Baseline scanning: `gitleaks detect --source . --report-path gitleaks-report.json`
- Manage false positives in `.gitleaksignore` (one fingerprint per line).

### detect-secrets

```bash
# Generate baseline
detect-secrets scan --all-files > .secrets.baseline

# Pre-commit hook (via pre-commit framework)
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
```

- Supports **custom plugins** for organization-specific patterns.
- Audit workflow: `detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline` interactively marks true/false positives.

### False Positive Management

- Maintain `.gitleaksignore` or `.secrets.baseline` in version control so the whole team shares exclusions.
- Review false positive lists during security audits: patterns may mask real leaks over time.
- Prefer tightening regex patterns over broadly ignoring files.

## Audit Logging

Knowing who accessed which secret and when is critical for incident investigation and compliance.

### Cloud-Native Audit Trails

| Provider | Service | What It Captures |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **AWS** | CloudTrail | Every `GetSecretValue`, `DescribeSecret`, `RotateSecret` API call |
| **Azure** | Activity Log + Diagnostic Logs | Key Vault access events, including caller identity and IP |
| **GCP** | Cloud Audit Logs | Data access logs for Secret Manager with principal and timestamp |
| **Vault** | Audit Backend | Full request/response logging (file, syslog, or socket backend) |

### Alerting Strategy

- Alert on **access from unknown IP ranges** or service accounts outside the expected set.
- Alert on **bulk secret reads** (more than N secrets accessed within a time window).
- Alert on **access outside deployment windows** when no CI/CD pipeline is running.
- Feed audit logs into your SIEM (Splunk, Datadog, Elastic) for correlation with other security events.
- Review audit logs quarterly as part of access recertification.
